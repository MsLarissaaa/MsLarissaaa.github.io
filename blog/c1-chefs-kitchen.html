  <h1>Impressions and Expectations of DBC</h1>
  <h2>Enthusiasm for a great adventure</h2>

      I'm very excited to embark on the journey of Dev Bootcamp, and in general I expect to be challenged, grow my strengths and capabilities as a developer, and have a lot of fun while in the program. I've really enjoyed the weekly exercises thus far and I appreciate the way the remote phase of DBC is setup. I like the kind of thinking that goes into coding, and I'm hopeful that a lot of the material will be engaging and feel like it comes naturally to me.

      One aspect of the video that most resonated with me was when Shereef was describing how he wanted DBC to feel more like a metaphorical kitchen, where everyone is involved in the creative process and takes responsibility for the experience and end result, rather than a restaurant in which participation is minimal and people are primarily passive consumers. I am also interested in a more hands-on, cooperative approach to education, and in unlearning many of the impassive, despondent attitudes we are socialized to have in school. I believe that the culture of experimentation and collaboration at DBC will be healthy and inspiring for me. I can definitely see myself thriving in this kind of environment.

      So far I have been impressed by the balance between independent learning and collegial support that DBC offers. I love that I am expected to work through the challenges and learn new concepts on my own by trying them, but if I am really stuck I can check in with my cohort on the Google+ group (along with other resources) to see if classmates or the guides can help me resolve the issue. In many ways this is an ideal way to gain new skills, since it encourages both self-directed learning and knowledge sharing.

      One thing that still concerns me is the problem of time management. Due to complicated circumstances with wrapping up my old job, I fell behind when I first started DBC and had to change cohorts in order to re-start the program. Several of the challenges so far have ended up taking me more time than I originally anticipated, although I have noticed that as I get more practice, the new challenges become easier and I can get through them more quickly. Shereef mentioned that one of the critical skills in software development is time management, knowing how much time to budget for a task or project and then getting it done in that amount of time. While I have been experimenting with different time management strategies (with varying success), I'm nervous about falling behind again and not being able to keep pace with the group. My goal is to work on my time-management one day at a time, and stay on track with the program one week at a time without having to take extensions. Apart from that, I think DBC is a great fit and I'm excited to keep going!
