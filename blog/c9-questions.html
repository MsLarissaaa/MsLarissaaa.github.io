  <h1>Asking the Right Questions</h1>
  <h2>How to ask in order to get useful answers & learn more quickly</h2>

      A critical component of learning anything, and programming in particular, is to ask appropriate, precise, and reasonably sophisticated questions. Regardless of whether you are asking an instructor to clarify a conceptual point, requesting advice from colleagues or classmates on the best operators to use in a given piece of code, or posting to stackoverflow.com in an effort to mine the internet's vast collective knowledge, a few guidelines pertain to asking intelligent questions which will ensure minimal confusion and allow for astute and constructive answers.

      First, when formulating a question it's always important to begin with the end in mind. Imagine that you are on the other side, being asked and trying to answer the question. What specific information would you need in order to give an accurate response? How much context is necessary to predict which situations your answer might apply to? Especially when being asked to explain a particular concept or operation, it's important to have some background on how or why it might be used. Therefore, when asking a programming question, be sure to provide context, including the language version, platform version (if relevant), operating system (if relevant), other software involved or unusual constraints, and the results of any research you have already pursued. If asking the question on a forum website, make sure to tag the question appropriately so it can link to related to questions and others can find your thread easily.

      Next, develop your problem statement clearly so that it summarizes your thought process around the issue. Your question should be specific, detailed, and foregrounded with the following: 1) what exactly you are trying to do; 2) what methods you have already tried in order to achieve this; 3) what you expected to happen versus what actually happened when you tried those methods. If possible, you may introduce your question with a kind of "executive summary", followed by a more comprehensive explanation of the problem. Perhaps most importantly, make sure that your audience understands what your larger goal is so that they can assess whether the method you're inquiring about is even the best approach to accomplish it. Again, the more detailed and explicit, the better; the person answering your question should know exactly what you're trying to do and why, as well as have an idea of what may be going wrong with the techniques you have already tried. It's a good idea to include sample code and data with your question, in order to demonstrate what you are doing, what the machine is returning, and what may be preventing your program from acting as you expect.

      Finally, you want to make a good impression with your question in order to solicit useful feedback. Be sure that your spelling, grammar and formatting are correct and professional, and that the question is presented in an accessible way which invites thoughtful response. You may pretend you're talking to a busy colleague; always research your problem before asking so that you don't risk wasting anyone's time. Introduce the question prior to posting any code, and formulate your inquiry such that others can easily reproduce the problem in question. Remember to proof-read before posting! And once you do receive answers, follow up and respond to feedback. The conclusions you draw from replies your question may be of considerable help someone experiencing a similar issue in the future.
