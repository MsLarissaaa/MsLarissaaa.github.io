      As you begin to learn coding, one of the most helpful and important tools available to you will be git. Git is a version control function which allows you to save and track changes to different versions of your work as you go, enabling you to keep track of multiple versions of work (in this case, code). Git lets you create and work on multiple branches of a particular project interchangeably by navigating between different saved (or 'committed') stages of the project. Git is local to your computer and organized into different 'branches', which are comprised of a series of 'commits'. When you want to save a version of the project/code at a certain stage of development, you commit it to the git branch. Then you can revisit that version any time you need to, for instance to compare changes made in the course of development or to revert back to an earlier stage of the project if a mistake is made later on.

      While git is not the only version control software, it is among the most popular, and virtually all programmers use some kind of version control function when working on a coding project. Version control tracks changes and development in a project or piece of code and allows you to navigate between different versions of the same work. Version control keeps tracks of your files and remembers all of the changes you make and when you make them, enabling you to compare multiple versions of code or return to an earlier version of the work if you find you’ve made a mistake. Git helps you keep track of changes to code by saving the versions of code that you commit at various stages of development; therefore, it is important that while working on code you commit your changes to git as often as possible, so that you can go back and identify specific changes made and their effects on the overall code if necessary.
    </p>

      As you're tracking versions of and changes to code using git, it is also helpful to store your code in repositories on GitHub (www.github.com). GitHub is a remote online collaboration hub that is analogous to DropBox or other document-sharing programs. It allows multiple users to access, work on, and track changes to the same project. While it has many of the same version control features as git, GitHub “lives” online and enables simultaneous work on branches of code by multiple users. Among other reasons, GitHub is helpful because it provides version control and change tracking for multiple users working on the same project. Because GitHub allows you to share work with others, storing your code there can be especially beneficial if you get stuck or need help from someone else to work out bugs and improve your code.

      To review, git provides a version control/change tracking function by saving versions of code in different stages of development to a local repository as 'commits'. Developers use version control (git) in order to keep track of changes and developments to the code they work on, to navigate between earlier and later versions of the same code, and to work on multiple branches or versions of code at the same time. To make your code accessible to others, it makes sense to store it on GitHub by pushing the commits you want to share to an online GitHub repository. This allows to multiple users to view, work on, and track changes to the code. Once you gain more experience using git and GitHub for software development projects, you will cultivate both an appreciation for the utility of these tools and a range of advanced skills that enable you to make the best use of them for coding.
