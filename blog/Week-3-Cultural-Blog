  <h1>My Learning Style</h1>
  <h2>Reflections on how I think and learn </h2>

      When I took the Gregorc Personal Thinking Style test, my scores were all pretty close for three of the four possible thinking styles, with Abstract Sequential a few points higher than the rest. I'm not sure that I would strongly identify with this thinking style, but reading more about it has given me some interesting insights to consider in regard to my learning process. For instance, while I enjoy theory, I think of myself as a more pragmatic, hands-on person who doesn't like to be limited to the world of abstract thought. However, I definitely prefer to analyze situations before making a decision or acting. I am almost compulsively logical and like to apply logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. I learn best when I have access to lots of references and information, and I enjoy learning in stimulating environments. While I am happy to work in a group or with a pair, I generally feel that I learn best when I'm able to work alone and solve problems for myself. In terms of what's hard for me as an Abstract Sequential thinker, I disagree with some of the traits that have to do with not being able to get along with people or work in groups; I believe I can be diplomatic when convincing others and avoid monopolizing conversations. It is definitely true, though, that I struggle with too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly and I dislike lots of extraneous rules and regulations.

      Knowing my personal thinking style is helpful for how I navigate my DBC journey in several ways. On the one hand, the highly logical nature of coding really appeals to me, and I like the work so far. On the other hand, I feel like DBC moves at such a fast pace that there often is not enough time to cover new topics in sufficient depth. My biggest struggle in DBC up to this point has been time management, estimating how long a task should take and then getting it done in that amount of time. My biggest issue following time management has been anxiety around the creative design aspects of web development, and CSS in particular. I feel comfortable solving a Ruby challenge which requires the logical deployment of a set of operations and which theoretically has a right answer; I was much less comfortable designing the CSS for my website, which would be judged subjectively based on visual appeal and felt altogether more like an art project than a coding challenge.

      I think this nervousness around the creative aspects of web development is where I most need to focus on cultivating a growth mindset. I notice myself wasting a lot of time agonizing over design details, or simply not wanting to work on the challenges that do not have a 'correct answer' or solution. I know that this anxiety is not serving me and represents the perfectionism indicative of a fixed mindset. I want to get more practice with 'putting myself out there' and allowing the websites I design in CSS to be works in progress that I can continually improve. Creative perfectionism is currently my largest impediment to a growth mindset, and overcoming this will be a big step towards developing a more balanced learning process.
