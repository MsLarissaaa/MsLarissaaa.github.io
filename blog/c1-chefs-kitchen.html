  <h1>Impressions and Expectations of DBC</h1>
  <h2>A cacophony of excitement and nervousness</h2>
  <h4>April 16, 2015</h4>

      I'm very excited to embark on the journey of Dev Bootcamp, and in general I expect to be challenged, grow my strengths and capabilities as a developer, and have a lot of fun while in the program. I've really enjoyed the weekly exercises thus far and I appreciate the way the remote phase of DBC is setup. I like the kind of thinking that goes into coding, and I'm hopeful that a lot of the material will be engaging and feel like it comes naturally to me.

      One aspect of the video that most resonated with me was when Shereef was describing how he wanted DBC to feel more like a metaphorical kitchen, where everyone is involved in the creative process and takes responsibility for the experience and end result, rather than a restaurant in which participation is minimal and people are primarily passive consumers. I am also interested in a more hands-on, cooperative approach to education, and in unlearning many of the impassive, despondent attitudes we are socialized to have in school. I believe that the culture of experimentation and collaboration at DBC will be healthy and inspiring for me. I can definitely see myself thriving in this kind of environment.

      So far I have been impressed by the balance between independent learning and collegial support that DBC offers. I love that I am expected to work through the challenges and learn new concepts on my own by trying them, but if I am really stuck I can check in with my cohort on the Google+ group (along with other resources) to see if classmates or the guides can help me resolve the issue. In many ways this is an ideal way to gain new skills, since it encourages both self-directed learning and knowledge sharing.

      One thing that still concerns me is the problem of time management. Due to complicated circumstances with wrapping up my old job, I was unable to complete all the work for week 1 on time and had to take an extension, which means that I've already started off on the wrong foot. Moreover, each of the challenges so far has ended up taking me much more time than I originally anticipated. Shereef mentioned that one of the critical skills in software development is time management, knowing how much time to budget for a task or project and then getting it done in that amount of time. While I have been experimenting with different time management strategies (with varying success) and struggling to get caught up, I'm feeling increasingly nervous about falling behind and not being able to keep pace with the group. My goal is to be totally caught up by the end of this week (now week 2), and if I can't do that I will have to carefully re-evaluate my time management and place in the program. Fingers-crossed that I get it all done in time, because otherwise I think DBC is a great fit and I'm excited to keep going!
