  <h1>Women in Technology</h1>
  <h2>Thoughts on the gender disparity in tech and how to reduce it</h2>

      A major issue facing the tech world is the disproportionately small percentage of women employed in the industry in general, and especially in technical and leadership positions. Based on diversity reports published by 11 of the world's largest tech companies last year, on average women presently comprise only about 30% of workers in the technology industry. Moreover, within these companies only around 16% of actual technical positions, and 22.5% of leadership positions, are occupied by women. In comparison, women make up approximately 51% of the US population and 59% of the US labor force, according to the US Census Bureau. Furthermore, while it is difficult to arrive at precise figures for income and advancement, studies show that women in tech are paid significantly less than their male counterparts to perform the same work, and are given fewer opportunities for promotion and career growth.

      As a woman pursuing a career in the tech field, I am concerned about these troubling realities and personally invested in seeking strategies to improve the position of women in tech. There are many steps that can be taken to draw more women into technical jobs. Companies should work on their outreach to recruit more talented women, and develop the diversity teams of their human resources departments to ensure that women's opportunities within the company enable them to advance. As a society, we could do much more to expose girls to science and computing at a young age, and encourage them to pursue interests in technology and engineering. However, I think the simplest solution available in this case is also the most promising: tech companies need to hire more women, for all positions and at all levels. If companies prioritize hiring and promoting women as a long-term business strategy, they will likely find that doing so cultivates a stronger workforce and a better, more dynamic industry, while indirectly correcting many of the subsidiary problems stemming from the gender disparity in tech.
